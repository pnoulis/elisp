# About

This repository functions as storage and development platform for my work in
elisp and perhaps other lisps that do not have a repository of their own.

Scattered across the directory tree are things such as:

1.  emacs snippets
2.  elisp functions created in the process of learning elisp
3.  elisp functions created in the process of exploring cs concepts
4.  etc&#x2026;
